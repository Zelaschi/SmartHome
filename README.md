# Introduction
SmartHome is the result of a mandatory proyect in my university developed with two more classmates (more on that later). The aim of the proyect was to create a Full-Stack aplication using .Net Core and Angular for the front-end. 
This application simulates the managment of Smart devices on an User's home. In this application you can log in as and Administrator, Business Owner and User.

## The process
During the creation of this app one of my classmates couldn't contribute much so together with my other classmate we pulled it off. The guidelines of this proyect where thought to be implemented by a team of three so we had extra load. Nevertheless we where able to implement everything that was instructed.
